# This file contains the links that should populate [Odysseus's newtab page](odysseus:home) if
# it is not yet fully populated with more personalized sources.

# Any link placed here should be of interest to a broad audience
# and no link here should incorporate DRM - Odysseus and elementary OS doesn't support that.
# Thanks to FSF's Defective By Design campaign for getting this list started.

# Lines starting with '#' (like this one) are comments, and otherwise
# a random link from a random non-blank non-comment line will be choosen for each slot.
